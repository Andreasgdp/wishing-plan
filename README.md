# Wishing Plan

Wishing Plan allows the user to tracks savings and calculates purchase feasibility of the user's wishes. It will also become a hub for planning bigger purchases with others, creating individual or collective wish lists to share on occasions like birthdays, Christmas and more.

# Development

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

- Use node version "^12.19.0 || ^14.15.0 || ^16.13.0 || ^18.12.0"
  - This is because of the compatibility of next-auth@4.17.0
- Install yarn globally `npm install -g yarn`
- Insdall Docker e.g., Docker Desktop for Windows or Docker Engine for Linux. See [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for more information.
  - This is to have a local database for development.

#### Windows

- Install win-node-env globally `npm install -g win-node-env` to be able to run e.g., `yarn db-seed` on Windows.

### Installation and setup

- Clone the repository
- Create local .env `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values
- Setup provider ([Example](https://create.t3.gg/en/usage/next-auth#setting-up-the-default-discordprovider))
  - For now you will need to setup a provider to be able to sign in locally; however, we are looking into simplifying the process by implementing Mock users/providers.
- Install dependencies `yarn install` or just `yarn`
- Start the database `docker-compose up -d`
- Run `yarn db-push` to migrate the database
- Run `yarn db-seed` to seed the database with test data
- Run the development server `yarn dev`

## [Project Board](https://github.com/users/Andreasgdp/projects/2/views/1)

For development management we are using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Andreasgdp/projects/2/views/1). In there you can see our backlog, issues sorted by priority and size. We are also working on creating a roadmap in there.
